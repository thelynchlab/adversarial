# Clinically Relevant Adversarial Attacks
Adversarial Attacks used to manipulate images in the 
[ISIC challenge dataset](https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main)
to highlight the potential challenges of using neural networks in the clinic. Adapted from 
[sarathknv's adversarial pytorch examples](https://github.com/sarathknv/adversarial-examples-pytorch)
